the ports of each constraint are immediately attached
as the domain of one port is whittled in one direction,
it must propagate through to the next, and each branch of the propagation
has its context, which can detect cycles

every propagation begins with a modification of the graph
one variable is added, with an unresolved domain, like a vacuum
as soon as this variable is placed, then, in being placed, its domain must be resolved
at each port a propagation begins: or rather, the ports suck in values from their connections
(and ports will be connected one by one); as each port changes value, its owning constraint must then
start propagations at its other ports; it's a system of ripples, though each ripple detects reaching its origin again
at which point it can only continue if it has narrowed that node (propagations must accumulate maps of visited nodes)

a variable by itself has 0..n ports, with the constraint that each exactly equals the other
creating a variable does nothing, but linking it immediately links two nodes: not just one but two propagations 
should take place; firstly the binding of the original variable is handled by the variable constraint
each other port's domain must be harmonized, coerced to equal the incoming; though this isn't a forceful overwriting
or displacement, but a merging;  

and what does the merging? the domains are generally susceptible to combination, but it has to be the constraints driving it

-------------------------------

an assert /is/ the same as the sampling, in that it locks down a domain to a particular value (many things will flow from this)

but it doesn't return a value like a sampling: an assert is always true;

there's a ruction here between saying 'this is true' and 'this could be true'
just constructing an equals expression doesn't say that that expression is true - it could be made just to be negated
there must be centres, sources of truth from which solutions propagate, ripple

yup, everything propagates from assertions
and if values become impossible because of competing demands from different assertions, their domain becomes /never/

and /sampling/? is that the same: in a way, yes. A sampling pins a value, which then determines other values.
how about enumeration of options? you get enumeration of worlds I suppose, from the point of view of the chosen variable

so - /pinning/ is in general done on a graph with normal graph effects; it ripples; every single addition of an action to the graph immediately ripples through it

--------------------------------------

I pin, and what? I assert, and what? Get on with numbnuts,

A constraint has its ports, its pins, each of which has a domain; as even without a binding, a leg must have a domain
when a leg stands alone, whatever the constraint gives it, it must have as its domain: there's no pushback


a three-pronged operator:
a > b = c

b:=3
the domain of this prong is set, is pinned; this sends a reverberation to its owner
the constraint '>' receives this reverberation, with a marker so it knows where it came from, its direction
'>' knows the domains of c and a - in this case they are happily 'any'

the problem is, is that there are two prongs here: '>' knows that c, having the lowest cardinality, can be used to pivot its
domains: it enumerates its pins' domains, sorts inversely by cardinality, and begins to enumerate possiblities;

'any' itself has a cardinality of one: it is undifferentiated; bool has a cardinality of 2;
so we enumerate from any, which results in a=any,b=3,c=true|false
'c' is true|false; projecting from here gives us (a<3,b=3,c=true)|(a>=3,b=3,c=false)

each possible choice is made, and the repercussions felt; each port therefore has its range of possiblities

but what when a port has a very large domain: b=0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8 is big enough to be worrisome
you don't want to enumerate every option; well with numbers, these here are homogenous, continuous;
could be computed as a range: b=0..8N; the domain then isn't disjunct, doesn't need enumerating

though it is truly disjunct; it's just that a naive unawareness of the homogenity of the disjunction leads to waste
a<b=c
a:=0..8N
b:=3
'<' knows that natural number a implies natural number b implies boolean c
c is disjunct; let's explore that...
when c=false,b>=0..8N >> b=0..N
when c=true,b<0..8N >> b==-N..8

at each update of a port, the operator knows what should happen to the other ports,
but what about pre-existing domains?

a<b=c
c:=true

a:=3
b:=N (subtypes any)
c:=true|false (merges into true as supertype)

c is disjunct, so know we explore:
c:=true
b:=4..N

c:=false
b:=-N..2

all possibilities are collected at the relevant points
leaving b disjunct: there's a choice of domains there

------------

however, do we lose the linkages between frames of possibility? 
unconvinced: we can't keep every implication in the graph, can we? well - we could

then a choice between two frames would be very simple indeed; hmmm

we want to narrow domains as much as possible to minimise the cost of updating, to store work in the immutable structures
a small change shouldn't cause much recomputation

but frames of possiblity are linked then, and it's only by an act of violence that they become pinned (or rather - that one particular frame is chosen)

maintaining the content of the graph would involve retaining links between frames, and there would be a massive number of them
but an entire separate frame wouldn't be stored; only links between the distinct options - if one option is chosen, then neighbouring points
will have certain domains; so each domain, being a choice, will have links to all other domains that follow from it

when c=true, then by the choice of this domain, other domains across the operator become known
all avenues need eagerly exploring to whittle down local possibilities; and in doing this a big network of domain assignments is spread

each time a possible domain is found for a port, we assign it as a local possibility to that port; 

-------------------------------------

a variable can be bound? presumably
x>3=true

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ports /always/ have bindings
ports in their pristine state are bound to a common 'any' constant
ports can have multiple bindings; which functions like an 'and'; a variable is just one big 'and'

but the bindings of a single port must agree on domain: it is basically a single entity
or - instead of having multiple bindings, maybe a binding can relate multiple ports
a binding is a set of ports that are correlated, along with a single domain across them

the job of a constraint is to react to changes in these domains, and to propagate its own domain changes out via other ports and other bindings




----------------------------------------

            //in binding, each port affected needs to be given the binding
            //but what about the old binding, eh?
            //we can't just summarily replace the binding
            //as severing the binding messes with whatever's bound at the other end
            
            //in binding, whatever bindings are already in place should be merged in
            //each port can have only one binding per environment
            
            //whatever domain the current binding has should be the least upper bound of the ports
            //it currently touches; any new bindings on top of this should only narrow the domain
            //
            //but what about disjunctions - aren't these expansions of the domain, sums of the domain?
            //well, they kind of are, yes; products are expressed via bindings, as all the individual
            //domains of the contributing ports are brought together, only what satisfies them all suffices:
            //each binding is basically an '&' relation - a foundational, primitive relation
            //
            //but, if '&' is so ensconced, then where is its opposite '|' - surely somewhere in plain sight it hides
            //also, where does it leave our constructions of constraints, with their ports?
            //
            //if a binding is an '&', then a three-way binding is two binary '&' relations chained 
            //all domains are narrowed, so this is fine, we can work one by one methodically until the domain of the whole
            //is achieved
            //
            //but if a binding is removed, or are in general removable, then domains can expand too - this means i think
            //that everything needs to be recalculated; whereas if they're only ever added, then we can happily narrow them down
            //more simply
            //
            //

-------------------------

so where is the disjunction? disjunctions are set up explicitly; and terms of a disjunction are only ruled out when they are narrowed to /never/

the most innocently simple introduction of a disjunction is in a relation with a port of true/false: boolean isn't a domain, but a disjunction

disjunctions are the thing, as they are the frames of possiblity of the graph

a boolean disjunct domain is pinned to a port via a binding to a Const
this domain has two halves, of course

and in its emplacement, must trigger a refresh on the contraint owner of the port
but not just one refresh: one for each possible value!

that is, true is firstly bound in one propagation, and false in another; each propagation has its own env, but as it proceeds, it 
gathers the possible envs and their bindings, so that each bindings possible domains can be found local to the binding alone as a disjunction

what we're really creating is an overall disjunction of envs; at each disjunction in the propagation, a distinct env is created
when we enumerate the possible values of a node, what we're really doing then is enumerating the possible environments; when we choose 

------------------------------------------

so each time we enumerate choices, we are branching off a new immutable env, with its own bindings
but, as some choices will be invalid, leading to nevers, these envs are to be suppressed

is it then, with every step of evaluation, a changing roster of envs is in place, each one giving a disjunction of values
to the various nodes? or do we say definitively, that a propagation has to complete, before it is registered as viable and visible

the problem we have here is that every env frame is final and obsolete after it has been formed, each intermediate frame is itself only

each explored frame could contribute itself to the general collection of likely frames, but this leaves huge duplication
the real structure to be tracked isn't one of frames, but of branches; and these branches need snipping if they lead nowhere good

so, a never needs returning somewhere - each branch needs its root, its controller; but then there are branches on branches - ie a tree of branches!
one branch that seems good in itself could be rendered moot by a bad sibling branch it knows nothing about

so, full awareness of what's available value-wise only arrives at the end of the overall evaluation; 
and each evaluation on each addition starts from a unique spot: when a binding is made, then somehow this ripples

the binding itself has no logic, but it notifies its subscribers of changesa to its domain; so - the very first binding is made...
two ports brought together; when a binding has been created pristine and registered in the map, then the constraints are notified of this
in some order, by the runtime.

so it's actually the graph that begins each reevaluation, driven by the initial act of binding; this then propagates via each constraint's handlers
so, the root driver then figures some bindings, but it won't always do the entire network - the propagation will be muffled if no domain changes are 
detected in some subbranch. Each addition makes for some changes, on top of the common pile of bindings.

but all changes coming out of a change will be known to its tree of propagations; 

how about - never spreads out from the tips of the tree as it's found, and eventually reach the root;
the only guard against the spread of /never/ is the disjunction; all other constraints are blitzed by it

--------------------------------------------------

so the idea is to let never spread: a never on one leg of a constraint inevitably leads to nevers on its other legs: it's just impossible to even contemplate it
the only guard is the disjunction; this makes it very different from depth-first search; it's an entire system evening out, settling

but, disjunctions are a thing: even the humble boolean, encountered here there and everywhere, is a disjunction; we can't avoid them, even in simple systems

x == 3 is a system of the ternary(!) operator `==`, one Var(x) and a Const(3)

if we were to sample `x`, or even, more like it, if we were to assemble this system, it would eagerly do this...

*bind x and Const(Any)*

*bind x and `==`*

*bind `==` and Const(3)*


------

there's a question of how we will represent and compute the product types of co-bindings
for storage reasons within the graph, we want there to be only one binding per port
and so a Var will only ever have one binding, as it only has one port

but if there's a preexisting binding, our new binding then needs to be combined with the existing
though - when we create the new binding, before it has all been equalized, then the binding is implicitly
between any and any, it adds no new information: so in the beginning it is just an extension of the existing binding,
a new port in its set of ports

but then - this binding, newly extended, needs to be bound to a new port: in this case there will only ever be /one/ new port
and this new port can only narrow the domain of the binding

so the new binding triggers a reaction only in the one recipient

every time a binding is extended, it faces a crisis, a present disjunction that it must harmonize
as soon as the binding is made this is the case; but only via the response of the port it has bound onto

the binding must tell the port its current domain; the constraint must then respond with a narrower domain that it finds fitting
or it must respond passively, happily taking on the domain of the binding as an improvement on its own

if a better domain is returned, then the binding must tell its other members of this new demand, and the rippling continues

the adding of a binding is no different from the propagation of a new domain via a binding: in both cases, the constraint receives it

there is the question of talking back, of there being a conversation... 
the binding has no choice but to take what it's given: there's no choice in any of this; so there's no advantage to going breadth first
with this; the binding in its rippling should take whatever's returned to it from the first port, then it should move onto the next,
meaning that if the first, when offered say `1`, returns instead `never`, as `1` can never be (under the condition of `1` as presented
being a fact, then its better, more narrow proposition, is just to say `no` - this is a better, more precise domain; it is helping)

...if the first port returns with `never`, then the binding must take on that better offer as a matter of course, and proceed to tell others
on its rounds that its domain is in fact now `never`: and so the black hole of impossibility spreads

the problem is, this parrying counter-offer needs to propagate back on its own course over the binding, even to the original propagator:
the counter-offer is in fact a completely new propagation; and should be impelled into the binding separately;

the binding then should do its rounds first (though this is wasteful...) before the ports are given a chance to make their feelings felt

here we need as always a protocol of communication between the various parts

-----------------------------------------------

each constraint firstly receives a new domain, and then must reply with its own narrower conclusion

it's best for it to reply first, as the narrower we can make the domain the sooner the better
breadth first makes more sense if branches aren't interdependent, but in this case they certainly are, and computation always tends towards simplicity

so - a constraint receives the domain, narrows it, sends it back to the binding; not as part of the same converation, but as a cascading barking of orders
the tendency is always towards narrowness - everything goes in one direction; it can be kicked down the hill by all and any feet at any time, and repeatedly

the context of the rippling, with all of its reassignments narrowings etc

--------------------------------------------------------

I've been saying that domains only ever get narrower - except for by disjunction, where there's a choice of possible values

Some part of me says that disjunctions can't be created out of nothing: ie you need a choice to have a choice; as if choices are only ever mapped

but then there is productive recursion, whereby going again and again across a discrete field - in fact, creating a discrete field of chained disjunctions - 
produces choices out of nothing. No; such a recursive construction requires a primitive, pure disjunction.

As in, the very domain is in all cases transcendable by choice: you have this, but you could have something else; at every point there's a disjunction

But we don't have this: we do have the cartesian product of all original disjunctions as possibilities, and we whittle these down into manageable scenarios

--------------------------------------------------------

Disjunctions can be merged into domains
a|b|c|r|s|t == (a-c)|(r-t)

--------------------------------------------------------

but if we newly assign a disjunction to a previous range
ie x:any -> x:1|2|3

then that only works because 1|2|3 is in fact narrower than any

that is, narrowing applies just as much to disjunctions

-----------------------------------------------------------------

when receiving a domain update, should a port handler reply directly?

no - it needs to proceed on its own course, with its own velocity, back even to the original original propagator
in rippling throught a binding, propagation proceeds to all but the source port; if we merely reply with a domain,
how can we be sure it will propagate properly?

this does though mean lots of stack usage, but whatevs

-------------------------------------------------------------------

Equality isn't the same thing as being in a range

if the result is true, then both legs /must/ be the same

1 != Int

The result being false leaves the legs free; but true is coercive

Const(1).In(Domains.Int) == Const(true)

---------------------------------------------------------------------

what would happen if we put consts in all the wrong places:

Const(1)`== Const(2)`== Const(true)

then we'd never know about its internal horrors, as there'd be no way of sampling an output from this closed system

---------------------------------------------------------

there's a problem now of priority:

if one port updates, it must change other ports to make them fit to it

in fact... doesn't this introduce a disjunction? I think it does.

a == b = r
a = 1
b = 2
r = false

if a changes, then either b is changed to suit it, or f flips
it depends which one has the force of assertion behind it

one of them, if it is pinned, can't be other than what it is
one of them will have leeway to change its domain

but does this mean that the same assertion has to be scrabbled together time after time?
not really, because everything should eagerly narrowed down to keep the network nice and tight

------------------------------------------------------------

so, disjunctions then...

when the ripple comes through, it must be explored in multiple directions
that is, multiple envs are created at the point of disjunction

and these are merged into the overall context - but what is this merge?

envs are themselves in a network, it's like the graph state isn't just in operations, but in the structure of env bindings beneath
one network bets the other

so when we add something to a graph, we confront its existing bindings: these are its existing envs, and propagating through these
requires choices to be made at every disjunction

this is the meaning of the disjunction: multiple paths we can take each time
which env do we want? 

------------------------------------------------------------

disjunctions interact with domains

domains are structured by disjunctions
always a set of ORs, and inside the ORs, there can only be consolidated domains;
you might find another disjunction via your first choice, but not immediately

--------------------------------------------------------------

there is a root env, and many subenvs branching from the domains of the ports

every binding then has, what - a tree of domains? there is a total domain per port,
spreading its options out, and with every choice we actually reduce the domains of all ports

graph has the total graph state, the current env, and whatever the momentary value is

----------------------------------------------------------------

the root graph links via discoverable domains to child envs, each of which links to further envs as choices are made.

I get how we can explore this structure by unpacking disjunct domains, but am unsure as to their creation/maintenance

it must be in the rippling, as domains are all stored in the bindings, and their development and growth in the ripplers.

Ripples both pass forward domains to other bindings, and pass back domains to the source binding

these domains are always disjunct, by default, even if they have only one or no options; and each one of the choices (if there are any)
is a surging possiblity that has to be followed as it has the force of reality.

such a multiple would then be received by a binding; nothing would be enshrined in the current env yet; but bindings would have to be committed before passing on the initiative,
otherwise the computation could circle back and find an obsolete binding value in place (though that would be fine, as everything tends towards narrowness)

i'm wrong then, we don't need to defensively commit, as all composes nicely

----------------------------------------------

as things are propagating, the envs are in constant growth/contraction; the overall graph finally settles

the envs branch like trees, but then these branches also loop back, and register themselves against ports they've already visited;
these new values are not distinct disjunctions, but are of the same branch, and should supersede the previous - in fact here the operation isn't `&`,
well... it is `&`: 
Int & 3 = 3 (because `&` requires /both/ from a value - the only value that is both Int and 3 is 3 itself: a narrowing)

envs /branch/... and the branches visit the same nodes again in a loop. But by the time they revisit, they may have split at a disjunction, and so the actual value coming in shouldn't simply override the previous, as now we're in an alternate world from the first (or rather, the first was a common root world; now we revisit, and our sibling approach might also, leading us to register an overriding disjunction with the root env)

in fact, there isn't just one root env, but there are many - and the availability of these envs at each binding domain depends on our path through the maze...
the overall env of course receives all possibilities: each and every disjunction is accumulated at every node, so we can, if starting afresh from a node, take any path from it;
but as we make choices, our local env does narrow, presenting us with fewer and fewer options

--------------------------------------------------

the question then is - how do we register looped domains back with original bindings?

some disjunctions might make it back, others not, but they should all accumulate there as they come in; it's like domains need to have some indicator of newness, some value that lets them override others; a kind of vector clock; but with the possibility of branching, this has to be itself a tree - a simplified representation of the domain's heritage; the simplest option here might be to use its real heritage: if each ripple had a link back to its progenitor, then a search could be made to see if the new domain superseded the current one (though, a new domain always supersedes a current one...)

New domains always supersede - the question is, do they supersede one particular disjunction of the current, or the whole?

nb: (a recipient will know which disjunction it itself is in at this point; it has its own state which should tell it how to treat the incoming...)

------------------------------------------------

a looping branch of env that comes back on itself circular; it will assign a domain narower than the previous domain, and if there are no disjunctions in play (the simple case)
it will simply overwrite, or propagate through the node regardless on its merry way, and all is fine.

but then we introduce the notion of disjunctions, and we should stick to the simplest scenario
with only one disjunction...

we propagate out a domain which thereafter splits; this then comes back via another pathway one at a time, each branch having its own env separately; and as such the original binding will know nothing of the second coming of the propagation; how even will it be accessible? won't it just be garbage collected as an unused, unneeded historical artifact?

if it exists in the env that makes it back to the root, maybe. But each first modification of the graph, each new binding from outside, makes its first incision in the context of the
root env that is registered with the graph; ultimately all perturbations must report back to the original caller; and when this env comes back, it must be assigned as root

the issue is that there are many other domains bound to other nodes of the graph;

----------

the surging branches of propagation will be eventually returned to their origin, and it is there, on their return, that they will be summed; in the actual act of rippling, each
ripple's world is its own; so the assignment to the root env of the graph will take place on the final return of the propagation to the original caller

but in this return and pool, reintegrative, phase - though it makes sense at the outermost root env return, does it make sense elsewhere at intermediate stages? the answer has to be 'yes', as the immediate env is the all wherever we are;
