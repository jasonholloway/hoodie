the ports of each constraint are immediately attached
as the domain of one port is whittled in one direction,
it must propagate through to the next, and each branch of the propagation
has its context, which can detect cycles

every propagation begins with a modification of the graph
one variable is added, with an unresolved domain, like a vacuum
as soon as this variable is placed, then, in being placed, its domain must be resolved
at each port a propagation begins: or rather, the ports suck in values from their connections
(and ports will be connected one by one); as each port changes value, its owning constraint must then
start propagations at its other ports; it's a system of ripples, though each ripple detects reaching its origin again
at which point it can only continue if it has narrowed that node (propagations must accumulate maps of visited nodes)

a variable by itself has 0..n ports, with the constraint that each exactly equals the other
creating a variable does nothing, but linking it immediately links two nodes: not just one but two propagations 
should take place; firstly the binding of the original variable is handled by the variable constraint
each other port's domain must be harmonized, coerced to equal the incoming; though this isn't a forceful overwriting
or displacement, but a merging;  

and what does the merging? the domains are generally susceptible to combination, but it has to be the constraints driving it

-------------------------------

an assert /is/ the same as the sampling, in that it locks down a domain to a particular value (many things will flow from this)

but it doesn't return a value like a sampling: an assert is always true;

there's a ruction here between saying 'this is true' and 'this could be true'
just constructing an equals expression doesn't say that that expression is true - it could be made just to be negated
there must be centres, sources of truth from which solutions propagate, ripple

yup, everything propagates from assertions
and if values become impossible because of competing demands from different assertions, their domain becomes /never/

and /sampling/? is that the same: in a way, yes. A sampling pins a value, which then determines other values.
how about enumeration of options? you get enumeration of worlds I suppose, from the point of view of the chosen variable

so - /pinning/ is in general done on a graph with normal graph effects; it ripples; every single addition of an action to the graph immediately ripples through it

--------------------------------------

I pin, and what? I assert, and what? Get on with numbnuts,

A constraint has its ports, its pins, each of which has a domain; as even without a binding, a leg must have a domain
when a leg stands alone, whatever the constraint gives it, it must have as its domain: there's no pushback


a three-pronged operator:
a > b = c

b:=3
the domain of this prong is set, is pinned; this sends a reverberation to its owner
the constraint '>' receives this reverberation, with a marker so it knows where it came from, its direction
'>' knows the domains of c and a - in this case they are happily 'any'

the problem is, is that there are two prongs here: '>' knows that c, having the lowest cardinality, can be used to pivot its
domains: it enumerates its pins' domains, sorts inversely by cardinality, and begins to enumerate possiblities;

'any' itself has a cardinality of one: it is undifferentiated; bool has a cardinality of 2;
so we enumerate from any, which results in a=any,b=3,c=true|false
'c' is true|false; projecting from here gives us (a<3,b=3,c=true)|(a>=3,b=3,c=false)

each possible choice is made, and the repercussions felt; each port therefore has its range of possiblities

but what when a port has a very large domain: b=0|1|2|3|4|5|6|7|8 is big enough to be worrisome
you don't want to enumerate every option; well with numbers, these here are homogenous, continuous;
could be computed as a range: b=0..8N; the domain then isn't disjunct, doesn't need enumerating

though it is truly disjunct; it's just that a naive unawareness of the homogenity of the disjunction leads to waste
a<b=c
a:=0..8N
b:=3
'<' knows that natural number a implies natural number b implies boolean c
c is disjunct; let's explore that...
when c=false,b>=0..8N >> b=0..N
when c=true,b<0..8N >> b==-N..8

at each update of a port, the operator knows what should happen to the other ports,
but what about pre-existing domains?

a<b=c
c:=true

a:=3
b:=N (subtypes any)
c:=true|false (merges into true as supertype)

c is disjunct, so know we explore:
c:=true
b:=4..N

c:=false
b:=-N..2

all possibilities are collected at the relevant points
leaving b disjunct: there's a choice of domains there

------------

however, do we lose the linkages between frames of possibility? 
unconvinced: we can't keep every implication in the graph, can we? well - we could

then a choice between two frames would be very simple indeed; hmmm

we want to narrow domains as much as possible to minimise the cost of updating, to store work in the immutable structures
a small change shouldn't cause much recomputation

but frames of possiblity are linked then, and it's only by an act of violence that they become pinned (or rather - that one particular frame is chosen)

maintaining the content of the graph would involve retaining links between frames, and there would be a massive number of them
but an entire separate frame wouldn't be stored; only links between the distinct options - if one option is chosen, then neighbouring points
will have certain domains; so each domain, being a choice, will have links to all other domains that follow from it

when c=true, then by the choice of this domain, other domains across the operator become known
all avenues need eagerly exploring to whittle down local possibilities; and in doing this a big network of domain assignments is spread

each time a possible domain is found for a port, we assign it as a local possibility to that port; 

-------------------------------------

a variable can be bound? presumably
x>3=true

------------------------------------------------------------------------

ports /always/ have bindings
ports in their pristine state are bound to a common 'any' constant
ports can have multiple bindings; which functions like an 'and'; a variable is just one big 'and'

but the bindings of a single port must agree on domain: it is basically a single entity
or - instead of having multiple bindings, maybe a binding can relate multiple ports
a binding is a set of ports that are correlated, along with a single domain across them

the job of a constraint is to react to changes in these domains, and to propagate its own domain changes out via other ports and other bindings




----------------------------------------

            //in binding, each port affected needs to be given the binding
            //but what about the old binding, eh?
            //we can't just summarily replace the binding
            //as severing the binding messes with whatever's bound at the other end
            
            //in binding, whatever bindings are already in place should be merged in
            //each port can have only one binding per environment
            
            //whatever domain the current binding has should be the least upper bound of the ports
            //it currently touches; any new bindings on top of this should only narrow the domain
            //
            //but what about disjunctions - aren't these expansions of the domain, sums of the domain?
            //well, they kind of are, yes; products are expressed via bindings, as all the individual
            //domains of the contributing ports are brought together, only what satisfies them all suffices:
            //each binding is basically an '&' relation - a foundational, primitive relation
            //
            //but, if '&' is so ensconced, then where is its opposite '|' - surely somewhere in plain sight it hides
            //also, where does it leave our constructions of constraints, with their ports?
            //
            //if a binding is an '&', then a three-way binding is two binary '&' relations chained 
            //all domains are narrowed, so this is fine, we can work one by one methodically until the domain of the whole
            //is achieved
            //
            //but if a binding is removed, or are in general removable, then domains can expand too - this means i think
            //that everything needs to be recalculated; whereas if they're only ever added, then we can happily narrow them down
            //more simply
            //
            //

-------------------------

so where is the disjunction? disjunctions are set up explicitly; and terms of a disjunction are only ruled out when they are narrowed to /never/

the most innocently simple introduction of a disjunction is in a relation with a port of true/false: boolean isn't a domain, but a disjunction

disjunctions are the thing, as they are the frames of possiblity of the graph

a boolean disjunct domain is pinned to a port via a binding to a Const
this domain has two halves, of course

and in its emplacement, must trigger a refresh on the contraint owner of the port
but not just one refresh: one for each possible value!

that is, true is firstly bound in one propagation, and false in another; each propagation has its own env, but as it proceeds, it 
gathers the possible envs and their bindings, so that each bindings possible domains can be found local to the binding alone as a disjunction

what we're really creating is an overall disjunction of envs; at each disjunction in the propagation, a distinct env is created
when we enumerate the possible values of a node, what we're really doing then is enumerating the possible environments; when we choose 

------------------------------------------

so each time we enumerate choices, we are branching off a new immutable env, with its own bindings
but, as some choices will be invalid, leading to nevers, these envs are to be suppressed

is it then, with every step of evaluation, a changing roster of envs is in place, each one giving a disjunction of values
to the various nodes? or do we say definitively, that a propagation has to complete, before it is registered as viable and visible

the problem we have here is that every env frame is final and obsolete after it has been formed, each intermediate frame is itself only

each explored frame could contribute itself to the general collection of likely frames, but this leaves huge duplication
the real structure to be tracked isn't one of frames, but of branches; and these branches need snipping if they lead nowhere good

so, a never needs returning somewhere - each branch needs its root, its controller; but then there are branches on branches - ie a tree of branches!
one branch that seems good in itself could be rendered moot by a bad sibling branch it knows nothing about

so, full awareness of what's available value-wise only arrives at the end of the overall evaluation; 
and each evaluation on each addition starts from a unique spot: when a binding is made, then somehow this ripples

the binding itself has no logic, but it notifies its subscribers of changesa to its domain; so - the very first binding is made...
two ports brought together; when a binding has been created pristine and registered in the map, then the constraints are notified of this
in some order, by the runtime.

so it's actually the graph that begins each reevaluation, driven by the initial act of binding; this then propagates via each constraint's handlers
so, the root driver then figures some bindings, but it won't always do the entire network - the propagation will be muffled if no domain changes are 
detected in some subbranch. Each addition makes for some changes, on top of the common pile of bindings.

but all changes coming out of a change will be known to its tree of propagations; 

how about - never spreads out from the tips of the tree as it's found, and eventually reach the root;
the only guard against the spread of /never/ is the disjunction; all other constraints are blitzed by it
