Enumerating disjunctions

A B   D   DA DBC
    *   = 
A C   D   DA DBC

A^B
A^C

in the above, it might seem that B and C need to be enumerated separately, but they don't
they can be tackled together

so we're not enumerating each group, but groups of groups
the next question is... how to do that?

we want to invert the negative disjunction operator into a positive conjunction

A^B =~ B&C
A^C

all groups without a disjunction separating them
are conjoined

we start off with one group and try to take all others we aren'tin disjunction with
