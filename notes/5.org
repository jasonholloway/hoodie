little dependent worlds of bindings

a dependent world overlays bindings, could even include new ports in binding

but then these are branches accessed via disjuncitons...

nothing new

------------------------------------

except, little encapsulated worlds are hidden, whereas here we percolate all outwards,
so that from the top, we can see all bindings against every port

encapsulation, of course, protects us from combinatorial explosion

but it requires programmer involvement

there'd be envs then, interlinked, but without visibility, well hurrah

------------------------------------

so we are where we were before

ports are related to bindings in a global env

each binding is then related to a set of disjunctions
in a local stack of envs

maybe ports can be the same however: different ports bound in different branches;

this would allow different variables to be attached in different circumstances then
